### Q1 What are the new things introduced in HTML5?
1. Semantic elements: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, etc. These elements make it easier to create well-structured and meaningful content, which is not only helpful for accessibility but also for search engine optimization.

2. Video and audio support: HTML5 introduced built-in support for playing video and audio content without the need for plugins like Flash. This has made it easier to embed multimedia content on web pages and improved the performance and accessibility of video and audio content.

3. Canvas element: The `<canvas>` element in HTML5 allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D and 3D graphics, which can be used for creating animations, games, and other interactive visualizations.

4. Offline storage: HTML5 introduced new APIs such as Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) and IndexedDB, which allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device, even when they are not connected to the internet.

### Q2 What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples?
Semantic tags are HTML elements that provide additional meaning and context to the content within them, helping search engines and web crawlers to understand the content better.
1. `<header>`: It represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links at the top of the web page.

2. `<article>`: It represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
