### Q3 History of javascript and EcmaScript. Explain in your own words?
JavaScript language was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally, it was designed as a scripting language for web browsers to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. Over time, Javascript became a popular lauguage for web development and was use to creat full-blown web application.

As Javascript grew in popularity, different web browsers implemented their own versions of the language, resulting in inconsistencies and compatibility issues between browsers. To address this problem, in 1997, a standardization organization called the European Computer Manufactures Association (ECMA) created a standard for Javascript called ECMA-262 commonly known as ECMAScript.
